# O III Level Populations

This repository contains a study of the relative populations of the O III ion energy levels
(³P₀, ³P₁, ³P₂, ¹D₂, ¹S₀) under different physical conditions.

The analysis includes:
- Critical density calculations at Tₑ = 10,000 K
- Relative level populations as a function of electron temperature and density
- Emission line ratio diagnostics:
  (j[OIII]4959 + j[OIII]5007) / j[OIII]4363
